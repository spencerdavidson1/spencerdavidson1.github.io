<p>Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing. Longitudinal stability isn't the only concern for lift truck operators. This is a lifting aid that you can adjust to your requirements, ensuring an efficient workflow, safe for both operators and goods.</p>

Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
