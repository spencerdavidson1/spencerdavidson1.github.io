<p>Our forklifts are widely demanded by various industries like textile, warehouse, chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aviation, glass, ceremics, construction, beverages, automobile OEM & its Ancillary unit. Better ground clearance than Pneumatic Tire forklift. Let our sales representatives know exactly what the application is and we will help you determine what type of forklifts are best. You'll now be able to see further down the road and over other vehicles. The conditions on site at construction, mining, forestry, and similar jobs are too tough for ordinary forklifts.</p>
<p>There are even lifted truck interest groups and clubs, which are excellent sources of information about the best local deals on these vehicles. Industrial Counterbalanced Forklift trucks have been used since the 1960's to aid in the transportations of heavy warehousing materials over short distances and heights.

<h2>Pallet Jacks And Their Usage Keithville </h2>
<p>701 Powered industrial trucks may become hazardous if adequate maintenance is neglected. From new and used sales to fleet financing solutions to servicing and maintenance, your local Cat lift trucks and warehouse equipment dealer is ready to help when needed. When you choose Thompson Lift Truck as your forklift dealership, you can always count on quality. That is what we have taken that out of the equation for you, with our delivery service for all new machinery and forklift rentals in our range.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>The other concept to understand is the forklift's center of gravity. We rent the following forklift equipment: Caterpillar, Jungheinrich, and Harlo. Created for small- and medium-sized manufacturing, distribution and retail installations, PowerFleet Essence is a new industrial truck telematics solution that addresses forklift fleet access control, safety and electronic record keeping for small fleets.</p>
