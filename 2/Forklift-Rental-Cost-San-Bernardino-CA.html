We are a full-service forklift and material handling equipment dealer, proudly located in Phoenix and serving the great state of Arizona.

Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.

The big diameter and width of the tyres together with a good ground clearance give a great safety, grip and stability for driving over obstacles at full load. Many of the hazards posed by forklifts can be mitigated with custom signage and clear visual communication.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing.
