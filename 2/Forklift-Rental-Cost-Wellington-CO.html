Our Forklift Service department and Forklift Parts department is proud to offer service and parts for all major forklift brands. The larger tires allowed by lifted trucks is one of the biggest advantages for going off-road with this type of vehicle.</p>

<h3>Forklift Suppliers Wellington CO</h3>

Reach trucks are used most in warehouses for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights. TPC Training's online and safety video training on Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
<p>We back most used forklifts with a 1 year parts and labour warranty. With excellent machine and load stability due to an optimum centre of gravity and suspension provided by large diameter tyres, these machines provide high mobility and great productivity in rough terrain environments. It is rumored that electric forklifts are maintenance free due to less moving parts and their cleaner environments.</p>
<p>Some appreciate the appearance of the taller stance of these vehicles, while others like the enhanced view of the road from the extra ride height. For more information on what documentation you should have, both on site and in the office, see Rough Terrain Forklift Documentation” above.

No matter what you are interested in, we have a dedicated customer service team that is ready to guide you through the process of acquiring the lifted vehicle you need.</p>
<p>Imagine the devastation of crashing with a semi-truck - that's the kind of damage you can expect from a lifted vehicle. Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
