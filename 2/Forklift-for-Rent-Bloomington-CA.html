Layman's Terms: Off-roading is fun, until you have to be towed 30 miles to a shop when your driveshaft falls out because you just had to have the huge lift. If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>

For example, a common system would involve a pallet truck feeding a reach truck in a unit load storage application, while the reach truck provides let-down for the pallet truck in low-level order picking.

The best place to hire a forklift throughout Melbourne, Victoria and Australia. A reach truck helps operators to put pallets away at height in narrow aisles. The controls of a forklift consist of a series of levers which open and close valves on the hydraulic cylinders.</p>
<p>This is an important distinction because in order to install a lift kit, the truck's body and frame must be separate.
