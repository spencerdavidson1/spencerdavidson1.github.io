<p>At the time, Vincent Halma, president and CEO of KION North America, said the rate at which we're releasing new products and services is truly unprecedented.‚Äù KION also recently announced plans to expand its South Carolina facility capacity to 12,000 lift trucks a year by 2020, up from 3,000 in 2015. The most obvious benefit is the increased ground clearance when driving over rugged terrain, which reduces the risk of damage to your undercarriage.</p>

<p>Drive the forklift forwards and backwards and in a figure eight pattern, stopping and starting in order to test the responsiveness of steering and braking. They are smaller than most forklifts and so are able to manoeuvre in those hard-to-reach areas. Forget parking garages, and height clearance could become an issue in some drive thrus. With breakthrough lift heights, capacities, visibility and energy savings, the Crown family of reach trucks can help you move and store materials efficiently.</p>
<p>The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking.

<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>But, I wouldn't be so quick to diss those who have lifted their trucks for better traction. I can have anywhere from 20 to 30 attendees representing 15 different companies (in the industrial, manufacturing, and construction fields) with each company using several types of forklifts. Rough terrain forklifts evolved from standard forklifts. Better Equipment: In addition to freeing up capital , leasing a forklift usually results in getting better equipment than you could afford to buy.</p>
<p>Top models are equipped with features that include robust transmissions geared for quick directional changes, custom tires that provide enhanced traction on loose, rocky terrain, and two- or four-wheel operation for safe, effective navigation. Rear steering makes it difficult to stop a forklift quickly or swerve and still maintain control. These tools and techniques should make cleaning any lifted truck easier, but finding a good auto detailer may be the more economical option if you can afford it.</p>
