Servicing industries including roadwork, forestry, agriculture, stock picking and more, we're Northern California's go-to source for Cat, Clark, Mitsubishi and other allied brand forklifts.

This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck.

<p>By control, by type, by load capacity, by end use industry and by region, to offer insights on the global Pallet Trucks market.
