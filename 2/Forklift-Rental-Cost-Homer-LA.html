<p>The load could also fall off or cause the forklift to tip. Stand-up trucks are the most common and are often used where there's only one load per bay. We rent counterbalance forklifts, rough terrain forklifts, high-reach telehandlers, 360 degree rotating telehandler forklifts , electric and manual pallet jack forklifts by the day, week, month, or longer.

<p>The load limit is shown on the data plate of the lift truck. Monster street truck drivers are at the distinct disadvantage in close quarters when maneuvering, such as in stop-and-go driving, city traffic, and even parking. Consideration should be given to reducing tilt speeds on trucks with extra high lift. Reach forklifts can operate in aisles as narrow as 2.4 meters, as opposed to the counterbalance's minimum requirement of 3.7 meters.</p>
