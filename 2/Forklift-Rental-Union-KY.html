<p>Charges will continue until the equipment is returned to the rental supplier and the equipment is available to be rented to the next customer. You might notice less suspension damping during long trips and on rough, uneven roads, but this only tends to be an issue if you're lifting your truck more than a few inches. We are the Forklift Professionals. For some businesses, hiring or renting forklifts makes more sense than buying it outright.</p>
