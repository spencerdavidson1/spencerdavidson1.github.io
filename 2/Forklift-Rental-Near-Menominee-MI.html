H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years.

Lift Capacity: 4000 lbs. Manufacturers of industrial trucks make a widespread contribution throughout the U.S. economy. For this type of forklift truck, a multifunction display can be installed and found in the operator's compartment.</p>
<h2>Different Forklift Types And Their Uses Menominee </h2>
<p>We pay top dollar for all lifted Chevys and custom-lifted trucks as well as jeeps. From our core Mitsubishi brand, to the new economical mlift range, the Bomaq off-road range and the specialist electric carer offerings. MHEDA's mission is to further improve the proficiency of independent material handling distributors in order that they continue to be the most effective and efficient conduit to the marketplace and to be a resource to all industry stakeholders.</p>
<p>Our counterbalance forklift training courses follow a specific set of guidelines as determined by NPORS & ITSSAR to ensure your staff are trained to the highest standard. They have dual forks at the front of the truck and a weight in the back to offset the weight of the load in the front. It is nice to have the selection of on-line, PPT, and video training to choose from., and the additional materials and forms made setting up our forklift safety program a snap.</p>
<p>There's a lot to love about lifted trucks but, simply put, they're not for everyone. Twin tube, monotube, and reservoir models are all available for anything you're taking on. For advanced off-roading rigs, we have you covered with shocks fitted for lifted suspensions as well as lift kits for DIY upgrades.
