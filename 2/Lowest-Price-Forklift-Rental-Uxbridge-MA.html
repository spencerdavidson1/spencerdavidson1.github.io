<p>LP engines, propane, diesel forklifts and more. Choosing the right forklift is important for your business. That also means you can take your lifted truck off the beaten path and drive it hard. But for serious off-road enthusiasts, getting a truck lifted or buying an existing lifted truck should certainly be a consideration at least.

The capacity of a truck equipped with load carriage and forks, or with attachments is the maximum weight, expressed in pounds, at a specified load center, which a given truck, based on the strength of the various components of the truck and, when applicable, on 406 of this Standard, can lift to the maximum elevation of the load engaging means.</p>
