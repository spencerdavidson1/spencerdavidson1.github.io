Rentals are also useful to those who experience increased workload on a seasonal basis. Forklifts have come a long way since 1906, when an official of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Altoona, Pa., added storage battery power to a baggage wagon, producing what was probably the first powered platform truck.</p>

<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>

<p>A soft dirt surface can cause a wheel to sink and destabilize an elevated load and the forklift. Forklifts may have a 4,000 or 6,000-lb. Has over 40 years' experience supplying customers with the right material handling and industrial equipment for their needs. Lifted vehicle suspension components become vital to its handling, performance, and driveability. We understand that your business experiences unique circumstances and equipment needs, and our convenient rental plans are designed to match your unique circumstances.</p>
