If you work in a small warehouse or need lift trucks for short runs, you can never go wrong with using electric motor hand trucks.</p>

<p>Log helps promote Forklift Operator Safety. Simplify your workflow when picking orders by attaching the TAWI Mobile Order Picker to any kind of forklift or pallet jack.
