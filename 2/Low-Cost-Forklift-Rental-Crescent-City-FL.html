Trucks should be recognized as being built in accord with paragraphs 7 through 143 of UL Standards for Safety 558, Second Edition, September 1961 Internal Combustion Engine-Powered Industrial Trucks” and paragraphs 7 through 130 and 132 through 187 of UL Standards for Safety 583, Fourth Edition, November 1956, Revised September 1960 Power-Operated Industrial Trucks.” Trucks and areas of use should be marked in accordance with NFPA Standard No. 505 — 1968, Section 800.</p>
<p>Also, the Entry Bar Safety Switch at the compartment opening on Crown's stand-up and counterbalance reach trucks slows the truck to a stop and sounds an alarm if operators attempt to drive the truck with part of their foot resting on the ledge.
