<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. A heavy attachment lowers the amount of weight that the forklift can support. One of the top reasons to consider lifted trucks for sale is because of their rugged good looks. They also invest heavily in the design of their machines to ensure optimal performance even on jobsites that include limited access terrain and high-reach areas. The forklift is designed with a load limit for the forks which is decreased with fork elevation and undercutting of the load (i.e., when a load does not butt against the fork "L").</p>
<p>Lift Capacity: 12000 lbs. The Raymond 5000 Series order pickers deliver exceptional versatility, intuitive handling and easy maintenance. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation avoid tipovers and accidents. Forklift training has many names, such as forklift licensing or forklift certification.</p>

When it's done right, you can expect a lifted Jeep to have better pulling power, a greater capacity to off-road because of its increased clearance, and the ability to use a much larger set of off-road tires.</p>
