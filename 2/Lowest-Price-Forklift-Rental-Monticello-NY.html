It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>This added weight increases the lifting capacity of the unit to between 2,200 and 4,000 lb. The load center is the distance from the forks to the center of gravity of the load. We offer certification on the Counterbalance Forklift from the following awarding bodies: RTITB, NPORS, CPCS, LANTRA.
