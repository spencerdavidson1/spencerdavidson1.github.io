<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. We have uniquely positioned ourselves as a topmost enterprise, engaged in offering precision engineered Electrical Pallet Truck Truck. Even for shorter distances you need the performance of the transport truck, because the pallet trucks have to master many difficult situations in a short time: Narrow aisles, tight truck loading bays or steep ramps make goods receiving and transport difficult.</p>

New Yale Equipment not sold by Pap√© Material Handling in the following CA counties: San Luis Obispo, Kings, Kern, Tulare, Fresno, Inyo and Madera. A body lift does not increase the clearance by a huge amount, other than by allowing for bigger tires that can help raise the underside.</p>

When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials.
