<p>Whether you are trying to learn more about these wonderful machines or perhaps hoping to diversify your fleet, here are the seven different categories of forklifts and a breakdown of what they are used for. Whether the driver will be using the vehicle for rock climbing, regular road travel, racing, or for use in sandy or water-filled areas, will determine the type of tires that need to be put on the truck.</p>
<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup.

<p>An important aspect of forklift operation is that it must have rear-wheel steering While this increases maneuverability in tight cornering situations, it differs from a driver's traditional experience with other wheeled vehicles. They can reach heights up to 390â€³ Orderpickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries.
