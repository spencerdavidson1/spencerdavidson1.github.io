<p>Towing: It's easier to tow heavier loads with a lifted truck since your truck won't be as at high of risk of bottoming out. If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. From lifting items into the shipping trucks to stocking things away in storage, their maneuverability lends well to various working environments and conditions.</p>
<p>This mainly due to the growing demand for material handling equipment across the manufacturing industry. The 8,000 lb. electric 4-wheel is used in higher capacity operations.

<p>Most rough terrain forklifts have ergonomic controls for easy, intuitive use. The warehouse forklift has two subtypes: the side loader and the counterbalance forklift. Since the 1960s, Caterpillar has been producing forklift trucks designed to last, and built to perform in some of the toughest and harshest environments in the world. Order picker forklifts are specially designed devices that are used to optimize the speed and ease of picking stock from both sides of a warehouse aisle.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable.
