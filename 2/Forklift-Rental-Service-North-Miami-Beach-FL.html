<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. Available for a majority of popular trucks including the 1500 Silverado and the Ram 2500, Fabtech makes sure your truck gets lifted the right way without taking any shortcuts. With lift heights of up to 8.5 meters and load capacities from 1.2 to 3 tons, the Toyota 7FBRE series, 8FBRE series and BT Reflex series offers truck models suitable for block stacking, drive-in racking, and long load handling.</p>
<p>In 1958, the first four-wheel drive rough terrain forklift was introduced. Once re-rated the forklift should have a new factory authorized specification plate, to replace the original plate, installed showing the new rating for the lift. The ITA says year-end lift truck sales totaled 260,180, with electric and internal combustion truck sales growing at similar rates (showing annual increases of 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively).</p>

Many models are equipped with stabilizers to ensure safe movement with shifting loads from one side of the machine to the other. When not in use, pallet jacks should be rolled into an area that does not have pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p>In addition, while reach trucks can be used at heights up to 40ft, this position places physical strain upon the operator's neck and eyes and so it not a recommended height for frequent use. Like most other lifts, a counterbalance forklift has a pair of forks in front of the vehicle. Additionally, the report enlists several leading companies that have generated substantial Forklift Trucks Market revenue in recent years and forecasts the companies that are likely to emerge leading in the coming years.</p>
