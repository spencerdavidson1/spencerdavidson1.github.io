The industrial forklift —also called a large capacity forklift—combines the functionalities of a warehouse forklift with that of a telehandler.</p>
<p>They offer numerous models that can suit any materials handling job. Order pickers work best in warehouses that operate for library archival storage, retail applications and furniture picking. Different forklifts are made for different loading capacity and height of pallet racks. While some lifts, like body lifts, are actually pretty straightforward, a mighty suspension lift can require a lot of extra considerations, parts, and work.</p>
<p>Guide rails, or electronic (or similar) guidance are suggested when lift trucks are operating in an area only used for stock pickers, side loaders, or order pickers. With rental, you know and control your forklift budget in advance and optimise operating costs by adjusting your fleet size to the minimum number of units needed.

<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame.
