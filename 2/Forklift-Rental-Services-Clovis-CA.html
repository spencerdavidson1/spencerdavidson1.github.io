These Lifts are designed to be able to lock on to the back of large over the road delivery trucks so they may be transported to work sites and then be able to off load product being delivered utilizing side offloading of the delivery truck.</p>
<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop. They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>
