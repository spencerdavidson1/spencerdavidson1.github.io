Heubel Shaw's large rental fleet includes Reach trucks, Stand up forklifts, sitdown 4-wheel and 3-wheel forklifts, order pickers and pallet jacks. Rather than installing between the body and frame, these kits are used to physically increase the height of the suspension for the pickup, which raises the body and frame.</p>
<p>Long Term Forklift Rentals have the advantage of providing your immediate Forklift needs and allowing your working capital to be utilized for re-investment back into your business. A body lift kit is much simpler to install - it just uses spacers underneath the cab to boost the height of the body.
