<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts are most optimal for outdoor construction and surfaces with difficult terrain. Forklifts are powered by electric battery or combustion engines. Today, rough terrain forklifts are a common sight on construction projects. Another safety feature that an electric reach stacker offers is an emergency reversing device in the handle.
