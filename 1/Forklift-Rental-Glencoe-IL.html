<p>It's called a counterbalance forklift because the load that's being carried in the front is counterbalanced by a heavy weight mounted on the back of the vehicle. Sit-down Forklift and Rider Pallet Jack experience is helpful. Workplace type and conditions are also factors in hazards commonly associated with powered industrial trucks. Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>
<p>It is designed to lift heavier loads higher in a compact footprint with improved speed and energy efficiency. We are largest supplier and importer of Electric High Lift Pallet Truck. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are the forklifts that do most of the materials handling work in industrial facilities today.
