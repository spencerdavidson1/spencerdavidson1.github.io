<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>While they move heavy loads and increase efficiency, forklifts can also cause serious injuries when they are used unsafely. Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision. OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.178 covering PITs requires employers to develop and implement a training program based on the general principles of safe truck operation.</p>

The wholesale distribution segment is expected to account for a sizable share of the overall Pallet Trucks market by the end of forecast period.</p>
<p>A subtype of the warehouse forklift, side loaders are usually found in steel service centers and manufacturing facilities with heavy and bulky items.

Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident.</p>
<p>The Industrial Truck Association has placed powered industrial trucks into 7 classes. Most kits include a standard or heavy duty compressor, a controller and all the hardware that you need to install the compressor onto your vehicle. This means that they are perfect for transporting heavy loads across rugged terrain, with some models handling up to 3 tonnes per load.</p>

<p>Single-reach models extend the length of one pallet and double-reach trucks extend the length of two. If you want to be well equipped to take part in all the off-roading opportunities North Carolina has to offer, buying a lifted truck is the perfect solution. These lifts allow you to add beefier off-road tires and heavier suspension components but do come at a higher cost.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
