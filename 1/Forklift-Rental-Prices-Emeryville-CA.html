<p>Warrior Quick Lift Pallet Trucks are manufactured from heavy gauge steel, with durable tandem nylon rollers and steering wheels for easy maneuverability when under load. The counterbalanced, fuel-driven forklift is suited for outdoor use. Internal combustion (IC) forklifts are powered by a traditional engine that runs on one of several types of fuel: compressed gasses or diesel.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
