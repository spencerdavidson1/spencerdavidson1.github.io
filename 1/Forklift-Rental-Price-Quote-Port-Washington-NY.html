In terms of volume, the global Pallet Trucks market is estimated to exhibit attractive growth rate over the forecast period. In the past this job was done with either ladders, a dangerous and ineffective solution, or with reach trucks with goods on pallets and blocked aisles. When the operator is done with pallet jack, he or she shouldn't leave the equipment just sitting out anywhere.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
