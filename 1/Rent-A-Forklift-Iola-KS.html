There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture. One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced — meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability. Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>
<p>To obtain a forklift licence in any State or Territory an applicant must undertake a training course with an approved training organisation and then, on completion of the course, apply to the appropriate State or Territory for a forklift licence. If you are not sure how everything works in a lifted truck that you want to test drive, ask questions. Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>
