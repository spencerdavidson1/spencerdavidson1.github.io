Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
<p>Some reach trucks come with a tilt mechanism in the cab to help the driver gain a better view of the operation.
