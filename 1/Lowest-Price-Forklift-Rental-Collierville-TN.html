<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,‚Äù are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>

<p>What you need to do: Take a practical test where the forklift is driven around a suitable course and the operator will be required to move and stack various loads, the test will also include one to one verbal questioning. Able to lift up to 8 t, these forklifts are rugged and suited for outdoor applications. Beginning mechanics may be surprised by the complexity of lifting a truck, particularly if the added height exceeds three inches.</p>
