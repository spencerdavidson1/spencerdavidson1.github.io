A telehandler forklift is also known as a telescopic forklift or a reach forklift. IC forklifts are a different class of forklift from the previous ones, as these models are often better suited for outdoor use. FMI provides an exclusive analysis of Global Pallet Trucks Market”. If you plan on going for the former, make sure you are aware of how much you have to spend on suspension lift kits.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
