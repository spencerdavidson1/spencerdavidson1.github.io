<h3>Reach Forklift New Iberia LA</h3>

Lifted trucks look right at home on any beach, and their increased performance makes traversing sand more satisfying than an ocean breeze. Our forklift trucks are dependable and reliable to get to the job done in a safe and efficient manner. With the test load supported by the forks in a normal and unrestrained manner and the mast at full rearward tilt permitted by the truck mechanism at that elevation, elevate the load to its maximum height.</p>
<p>Train the Trainer” is a six-hour course in which I review OSHA regulations; how to evaluate an operator's performance during a driving test; and how to properly operate and maintain forklifts in terms of their controls, attachments, maintenance, rules of the road, and so on. I charge $175 per person, but similar programs can range anywhere from $150 to $600 per person.</p>
