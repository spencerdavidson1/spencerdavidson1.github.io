<p>Equipment Solutions for Your Short and Long-term Rental Needs. Lifted trucks have ample appeal—they provide an elevated line of sight, greater ground clearance and, most importantly, that head-turning, rugged coolness factor so many of us envy. Ideal for narrow aisles the side stance truck has the forks located on the side of the cab affording excellent visibility for the operator and minimizing maneuvering. CLARK Material Handling Company is so proud of this patent that they even sell t-shirts with pictures of the patent claim.</p>
<p>Featuring a hydraulic jack that is manually operated from the handle, the manual pallet jack gets it name from the manual pump input to raise the fork. Thanks to their high capacity of up to three tons and excellent manoeuvrability in even the tightest of spaces, hand pallet trucks represent ideal warehouse aids. They may be a bit worn out, so when the lift is installed, the proposed 2 inch leaves may only have lifted the truck 1.5 inches.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Choosing a Forklift Lease Agreement in Graham </h2>
<p>Up one spot to No. 13, Ireland-based Combilift, makers of four-directional forklifts, side-loading equipment and straddle carriers, grew 7% after selling 4,350 units in 2016, an 11.5% increase from the previous year. We are supplier, importer and exporter of 3- Wheel Electric Forklift Trucks (RCF). Alternatively, our LPG forklift trucks are flexible enough for both indoor and outdoor usages.</p>
<p>The goal of the course is to help small businesses become self-sufficient regarding forklift operator training (upon successfully attending the class, individuals are certified to train fellow workers at their own place of employment). The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>
<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail. Customization and accessories for trucks go beyond what the manufacturer offers on brand new models, however, giving truck drivers even more freedom to make their pickups their own. Forklift rentals require research and planning, and that's where the experienced team at Thompson Lift Truck can help.</p>

Counterbalanced = A lift truck that utilizes weight in its chassis to counterbalance a load against the center line of the drive wheels. Trucks with electric steering include the Active Traction system with innovative hydraulics that adjusts the pressure on the traction tyre depending on loading conditions for faster travel speeds and better traction on ramps.</p>
<p>Sharing a chassis with the 7300 series "severe-service" truck, it comes from the factory with a permanent all-wheel drive train, heavy duty anti-lock air drum brakes, and either a 7.6L or 8.7L inline six cylinder turbo diesels.
