<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components.

Unlike standard forklifts, Agria are fitted with heavy duty pneumatic tyres, specifically designed for rough terrain operation.</p>
<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>
<p>A little more lifting capacity means the 3,500 lb. forklift can do more than the 3,000 lb. But you don't have to sacrifice the small footprint, as the truck sits on the same size frame.

<p>When you rent a rough terrain forklift, you want to make sure it has enough power to do the job. While forklifts in this class can also be used for a variety of tasks, they're generally more suited for picking up and putting away pallets of inventory. On a powered pallet truck, however, the lifting of the load, and truck movement, is powered by the electric motor within the machine.</p>

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>The load limit is shown on the data plate of the lift truck. Monster street truck drivers are at the distinct disadvantage in close quarters when maneuvering, such as in stop-and-go driving, city traffic, and even parking. Consideration should be given to reducing tilt speeds on trucks with extra high lift. Reach forklifts can operate in aisles as narrow as 2.4 meters, as opposed to the counterbalance's minimum requirement of 3.7 meters.</p>
