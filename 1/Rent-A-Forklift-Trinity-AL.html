If the truck is equipped with front-end attachments other than factory installed attachments, the user shall request that the truck be marked to identify the attachments, show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination, and the capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation with load laterally centered.</p>
<p>Popular types are high-lift fork truck, high-lift ram truck, high-lift boom truck, high-lift clamp truck, and high-lift platform truck (Fig. ATTACHMENT: A device other than conventional forks or load backrest extension, mounted permanently or removably on the elevating mechanism of a truck for handling the load.

Linde forklift hire equipment is delivered ready to give the productivity boost your business needs, from the moment your operator sits at the forklift controls.</p>
