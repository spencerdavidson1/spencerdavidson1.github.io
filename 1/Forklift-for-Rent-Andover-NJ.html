<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support. Call Andy Putnam, Rental Manager (315) 413-4150 or use the Rentals Request form to send us a Quick Request.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>
<h2>How to Determine the Value of a Used Forklift in Andover </h2>
<p>These sit-down rough terrain forklifts have all been checked upon purchase to determine that they are in good working order. The reach forklift is capable of performing the same types of work as the counterbalance and can be fitted with attachments for special lifting jobs as required. When a 15,500 lb. forklift isn't enough, you'll need a high-capacity cushion forklift to get the job done.</p>
<p>Gap guards are used to fill in this area and make these lifted trucks look better. Our reach truck training courses are ideal as conversion training for operators already experienced and skilled in using typical counterbalance fork lifts, with a range of the essential skills and knowledge crossing over between the two. An unimpeded view of loads and the surrounding area are a fundamental requirement for safe truck operation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we offer our customers the possibility of covering their machinery damage with STILL Rental Plus. This is the total amount of weight the forklift can move off the ground.

As someone with no forklift experience, you will do between three and six days of training before you take the test. Truck should be placed on an initially level test platform with the axis of the load wheels parallel to the tilting axis of the platform.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice. Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
