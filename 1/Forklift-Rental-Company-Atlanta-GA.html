<p>The goal of the course is to help small businesses become self-sufficient regarding forklift operator training (upon successfully attending the class, individuals are certified to train fellow workers at their own place of employment). The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>
<p>Transmissions on forklifts, in particular, can be subject to abuse. When not used for picking, these trucks can also be used for the transport or stacking of pallets. With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications.</p>

Where possible, fork loops or jugs should be provided for handling by fork trucks. Whilst implementing some or all of the relevant measures above will greatly reduce the fall risk to operators, the best solution is to provide order pickers with fully enclosed platforms.</p>
<p>Charges will continue until the equipment is returned to the rental supplier and the equipment is available to be rented to the next customer.
