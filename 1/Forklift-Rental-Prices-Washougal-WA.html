It is also backed with priority support from our nationwide team of field service forklift technicians. While it can't reach difficult angles the way that a telehandler can, it is capable of lifting payloads much higher off the ground than a warehouse forklift and heavier loads.</p>
<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>
<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame. I'm talking about the unGodly big, oversized tires, mudflaps, etc type of trucks that look completely and utterly ridiculous. Rough terrain forklifts provide a high degree of mobility and safety as well as access to areas that would otherwise be off limits. Featuring big, tractor-style tires that provide plenty of traction to handle even the most challenging outdoor terrain, these rugged trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and used outdoors.</p>
<p>Forklift operators can lift up and lower the forks, use side shifters to move loads and tilt the mast so the load doesn't slide off the forks. The multidirectional BT Reflex F-series of reach trucks offer AC power, clear-view masts, 360° steering and sideways battery exchange for increased productivity and manoeuvrability.

Keep all parts of your body inside the industrial lift truck when travelling; travel with the forks as low to the floor as possible; decrease speed around corners and sound the horn; and, travel in reverse when a load obstructs your vision.</p>
<p>But, I wouldn't be so quick to diss those who have lifted their trucks for better traction. I can have anywhere from 20 to 30 attendees representing 15 different companies (in the industrial, manufacturing, and construction fields) with each company using several types of forklifts. Rough terrain forklifts evolved from standard forklifts.
