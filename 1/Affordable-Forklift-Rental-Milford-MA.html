The order selector operators ride up and down with the load and must be secured to the truck using a belt and tether system.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator stands, a vertical clearance of at least 74 inches should be maintained from the platform where he stands to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation.
